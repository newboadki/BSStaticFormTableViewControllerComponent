/*!BSStaticCells can have any kind form, i.e. a segmented control, a text field, etc. Therefore, the kind of value the cell understands in order to
 programatically change its state is different. For example a segmented controller Cell to represent categories of an entity understands that
 needs to select the segment at index 4 but it will not understand what index to select if it's passed a particular instance of a Category.
 This protocol comes in to decouple the cell and it's internal values from the ones that a user of the cell might understand.*/
